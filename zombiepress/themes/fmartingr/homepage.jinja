        <p>Hi there!</p>
        <p>My name is Felipe Mart&iacute;n, and I'm a developer.</p>
        <p>I've been playing with code for a while now, but I also enjoy geeking around with computers, algorithms and stuff; the less I know about it, the better. Learning new things everyday is <em>my</em> way of life.</p>
        <p>Currently I'm a web developer, but I like to learn from new areas on my spare time, like networking, security or game development, I want to create some cool stuff for everyone to see.</p>
        <p>If I'm not in front of my computer, you'll probably find me walking around the city with my headphones or having a beer with my friends.</p>
        <p>You can access my blog and projects from the left. My contact details are around there too so feel free to drop me a line if you want!</p>
